* NLP Summit Healthcare 2025 Tracking Repository
This repository is designed to track sessions, contacts, and knowledge base topics for the [[https://www.nlpsummit.org/healthcare-2025/][NLP Summit Healthcare 2025]] event.

** Overview
This repository provides a structured approach to tracking information related to the NLP Summit Healthcare 2025 conference, including:

- Session details and notes
- Speaker contacts and networking information
- Knowledge base topics and research areas

** Repository Structure
- =sessions/= - Information about conference sessions
- =contacts/= - Details about speakers, attendees, and other contacts
- =kb/= - Knowledge base topics and notes
- =docs/= - Generated documentation and reports
- =nlp_healthcare_summit_2025/= - Python package for processing data

** Getting Started

*** Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Emacs with org-mode (optional, for org-mode functionality)

*** Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nlp-healthcare-summit-2025
   #+end_src

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   #+begin_src shell
   poetry install
   #+end_src

*** Usage
- Use the org-mode templates in =sessions/=, =contacts/=, and =kb/= directories to track information
- Use the Makefile to manage repository tasks:
  #+begin_src shell
  # Show available commands
  make
  
  # Install dependencies
  make install
  
  # Process all data and generate visualizations
  make update
  
  # Lint org files
  make lint
  
  # Tangle all org files to extract source code
  make tangle
  
  # Process specific data
  make process-sessions
  make process-contacts
  make process-knowledge
  
  # Clean generated files
  make clean
  #+end_src

** Features
- *Org-mode Templates*: Structured templates for tracking sessions, contacts, and knowledge base topics
- *Python Processing*: Scripts for analyzing and visualizing the data
- *Network Visualization*: Generate visualizations of speaker connections and topic relationships
- *Poetry Integration*: Managed dependencies for reproducible environments

** Session Tracking
The =sessions/nlp_summit_sessions.org= file contains detailed information about all sessions from the NLP Summit Healthcare 2025, organized by day and track. Each session includes:

- Title, track, date, time, and format
- Speaker information
- Content details (description, key topics, technologies, applications)
- Space for notes

** Contact Management
The =contacts/speakers.org= file provides a comprehensive database of all speakers at the summit, including:

- Contact information
- Organizational affiliations
- Research interests and expertise
- Space for interaction notes

** Knowledge Base
The =kb/topics.org= file organizes key topics from the summit, including:

- Topic descriptions and categorizations
- Current state and future directions
- Healthcare applications
- Related sessions and contacts

** TODO Research Papers to Complete by EOD [0/3]
- [ ] Complete summary of PaliGemma-CXR paper for Sahar Kazemzadeh's presentation
- [ ] Finalize literature review on Medical LLM evaluation benchmarks for Veysel Kocaman's talk
- [ ] Prepare notes on Graph RAG architecture for Kais Zhioua's presentation
